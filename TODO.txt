REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

AnimationTimer is so confusing - get rid of it.  Just update each frame as needed

Get SDL to allow window resizing and toggle window/fullscreen
    how does this affect collision and so forth???
    maybe have a way to display coordinates on mouse position???
    current hard coded coordinates don't work for full screen - need to grab current window size - not the saved ones

    related: need to scale bounding boxes too to window sizes

Add in BeginScene and EndScene to sandwich DrawScene is Renderer class 
    put all clear Quad code (this should be private) and any other housekeeping code in Begin and End
    DrawScene should only have the actual drawing stuff


Application
    add functions to load texture, and add sprite based on texture
    should be loading assets in main(), before app->Run() is called



Have a way to set size of entity (eg, 64 x 32), so that sprite can vary in size
    bounding boxes are buggy (smaller than they should be)
    seems to be an issue with screen resolution and window size (related to below)
    Everything breaks when switching off fullscreen
        think about how I want to do this and togglefull screen often to check (maybe should make a key for this??? so I can change it during runtime)

Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
