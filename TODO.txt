REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Textures:
    tex coords need to correspond to each vertex
    so i need to keep the 5 float vertex setup
    will need to make a list of vertices and indices (like what i had before - have to create VertexBuffer and IndexBuffer class - vertex array is not needed)
        each quad in the list will also need a corresponding model matrix that needs to be set as the model uniform in shader
        can use static const array of vertices corners (default), but need to assign them different texcoords
        AddQuad(width, height, texcoordsStart, texCOordsEnd)

Everything breaks when switching off fullscreen
    think about how I want to do this and togglefull screen often to check (maybe should make a key for this??? so I can change it during runtime)

Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)
