CMAKE HIERARCHY
    -do i want multiple levels, or is just the root CMAKE file sufficient??

SDL LIBRARY
    -need to figure out how to use SDL (either as dynamic (shared) or static library)
    -currently, I just copied dll into same directory as executable
    -static will be faster, but I'll need to download SDL source, and build
    -dynamic, I'm not sure
