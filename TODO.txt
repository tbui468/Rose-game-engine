REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)


Fractals - the big one here.  The last large piece to get back to working status

    1. Get Fractals responding to user input
        need to add more possible user inputs - Flick in four directions
    2. Forming larger fractals and splitting into smaller fractals (this should be a command called by puzzle)

    1. Get Fractals data to read from external JSON
    2. Get Fractals data to write to external JSON

    1. Translations of fractals
    2. Rotations of fractals
    3. Reflections of fractals

Allow window scaling when the application is active
    should check online for reference material on how to change SDL2 window sizes (event)

Everything is squished when the aspect ratio is not a 480x270 ratio
    how do I fix this?  I want everything to look that same (eg same height/width ratio) regardless of window ratio
    Two things:
        1. Currently, the projection matrix in renderer is hard coded to 480x270 - need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        2. Currently, Squares.cpp uses 480x270 world space (related to projection) need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        3. Need to accomodate window scaling too

    Tests: (all squares should be squares, and rectangles should be 2:1)
        1. Check fullscreen
        2. Check windowed with 480x270 aspect ratio
        3. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 2:1
        4. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 1:2

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
