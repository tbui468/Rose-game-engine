REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Fractals - the big one here.  The last large piece to get back to working status

    Have Fractals create custom textures on instantiation
        can use GetApplication() to grab a handle to application, then grab a handle to renderer
            loop through elements in fractal (Element.Empty, Element.Red, Element.Blue, etc)    
                renderer->CopyTexture(elementType, fractalIndex) //fractalIndex is essentially the {col, row} we are iterating through

        'CopyTexture' needs to look through a dictionary to find where each element type is in the default texture

        create enum class for Fractal elements
        
    Benchmarking - use website to drag/drop JSON file
        look at Instrumentor class (and utility classes) on Hazel/Debug
            build it incrementally and compile as you go 
            -Instrumentor constructor and static Get() method
            -Instrumentor data struct and the WriteProfile() method (this is the JSON stuff)

    Pinchout and pinchin Fractals to change sizes
        First get split working (since it's easier)
            Write Puzzle::Split(Fractal* f)
            Will need to change Fractal constructor to allow different fractal sizes 
                this will require a way to create new textures....this might be tricky
            will need to write static Fractal functions that calculate fractal location based on size and target size
                

    Entity uses the singleton GetApplication() to draw
        Make a RenderCommand purely static class so that Entity can call it without needing access to application/renderer
            RenderCommand::StartScene() should also call RenderCommand::Clear() and any OpenGL commands needed before drawing
            RenderCommand::AddQuad() //just adds vertices/indices.  called by Entites in Layer::Update(....)
            RenderCommand::Draw() 
            RenderCommand::EndScene(); //should clear the index/vertex buffers/swap screen buffers and do anyother cleanup needed for OpenGL

    Renderer is bound to a context (the Window).  So who should own what?

    let's keep the singleton for now, but I might get rid of it later



    1. Get Fractals responding to user input
        how should the inputdispatcher process inputs??
            write out the API I want to use in Squares.cpp to process all inputs coming in from Rose engine
            then declare/implement those functions
            InputDispatcher will also need to keep track of animation timing...
                it might be a good idea to pull all that stuff scattered all over the Layer Update() function 
                into the InputDispatcher to process
                function calls can then be used on the InputDispatcher to get necessary data

    2. Forming larger fractals and splitting into smaller fractals (this should be a command called by puzzle)

    1. Get Fractals data to read from external JSON
            how are JSON files formatted????
    2. Get Fractals data to write to external JSON

    1. Translations of fractals
    2. Rotations of fractals
    3. Reflections of fractals


Allow window scaling when the application is active
    should check online for reference material on how to change SDL2 window sizes (event)

Everything is squished when the aspect ratio is not a 480x270 ratio
    how do I fix this?  I want everything to look that same (eg same height/width ratio) regardless of window ratio
    Two things:
        1. Currently, the projection matrix in renderer is hard coded to 480x270 - need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        2. Currently, Squares.cpp uses 480x270 world space (related to projection) need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        3. Need to accomodate window scaling too

    Tests: (all squares should be squares, and rectangles should be 2:1)
        1. Check fullscreen
        2. Check windowed with 480x270 aspect ratio
        3. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 2:1
        4. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 1:2

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)

Need to make sure MAX_VERTEX size in shaders are below hardware max
