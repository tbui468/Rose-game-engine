REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

    PITCH: An application teaching goemetric transformations using puzzles, but the app itself is a puzzle the user must explore to unravel

    THE BIG THREE:

            Blue bottom right in puzzle 1, puzzleset 1 shows up in 2x2 fractal constructor after merging okay

            By the time I call Split in MenuLayer, blue fractal in bottom right corner is gone (when I check GetSubElement)

            run app and merge and split to see notes - why is m_Elements changing between these two times???

                m_Elements is correct when we call Fractal(...) constructor

                    this becomes false on the next frame...

                m_Elements is wrong when we call MenuLayer::SplitFractal()

            FOUND IT!!!! Problem with GetSubElement - it needs to know the size of the subelements needed AND the size of the fractal it is from
                these may be different (and most often are) and I'm not taking that into account
                Can use GetSize() to find the size of the current fractal

        3. Core Puzzle Features - transformations/splitting/forming and puzzle clear/puzzleset clear (Spend mornings on this)

            Complete MenuLayer::UndoResizeFractals() - removed this function from puzzle class since it's easier to understand for now in MenuLayer
                can re-add this function afterwards if it makes sense

                carefully check all conditions here - this is the most complex part of the application so far

            Implement InputQueue, with a similar format to the command queue,
                If the player inputs while animation is playing, save the input type (including the x and y)
                Once the current animation is done playing, trigger the next AddCommand(...) by using the queued inputs
            
        1. Save/load system - SDL_GetPrefPath

            Write out data to profile.json to make sure it saves correctly

            Read data in from profile.json if it exists

            Default data should also be move out of json file - should write it in c++ and compile it with executable
                so that user can't accidentally delete default data

            once I understand the parser function in json class, try to roll my own parser
                it doesn't need to be the 50,000 line beast that is the library I'm using
                make it rigid and only capable of reading/writing to the specific format for my app

        2. Audio - FMOD
            Sound is playing on translate up 
            Get music looping

        Learn.
            Watch Javidx9 videos or look through the code of his game engine
                get a working program compiled with his engine, and
                step through the code to see how he structured everything (especially the renderer and entity relationship for Draw())

            OLCGameEngine
                application->Draw(....) is how the application draws stuff
                I could just do Draw(entity.x, entity.y, entity.Sprite, etc) to draw
                    but i need to be able to draw objects and entity contains too


Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Open and build in visual studio using solutions generated by cmake to test if it works

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC) and the LLVM one (Clang)

Need to make sure MAX_VERTEX size in shaders are below hardware max 

Make sure I'm compile to release mode (and not debug) with optimizations turned to max
