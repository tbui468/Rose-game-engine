SDL2 tutorial easy cleanup


Each entity/object on screen IS a quad (inherits from Quad)
    Make Quad class the contain general functions for all entities
        Quad()
        Draw() (but should save a reference to all entities in a list and make a draw call all in a drawing controller)
        DrawTransformed() "
        MoveTo
        ScaleTo
        FadeTo
        RotateTo
        Collision
        SetBoundingBox
        SetSprite

Asset sprites Loading
Access OpenGL from SDL

SDL LIBRARY
    -need to figure out how to use SDL (either as dynamic (shared) or static library)
    -currently, I just copied dll into same directory as executable
    -static will be faster, but I'll need to download SDL source, and build
    -dynamic, I'm not sure
