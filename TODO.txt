REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Fractals - the big one here.  The last large piece to get back to working status

    Entity uses the singleton GetApplication() to draw
    Input uses the singleton GetApplication() to get app and window to process inputs
        Input should be something the application owns 

    let's keep the singleton for now, but I might get rid of it later

    1. Get Fractals responding to user input
        how should the inputdispatcher process inputs??
            write out the API I want to use in Squares.cpp to process all inputs coming in from Rose engine
            then declare/implement those functions
            InputDispatcher will also need to keep track of animation timing...
                it might be a good idea to pull all that stuff scattered all over the Layer Update() function 
                into the InputDispatcher to process
                function calls can then be used on the InputDispatcher to get necessary data

    2. Forming larger fractals and splitting into smaller fractals (this should be a command called by puzzle)

    1. Get Fractals data to read from external JSON
            how are JSON files formatted????
    2. Get Fractals data to write to external JSON

    1. Translations of fractals
    2. Rotations of fractals
    3. Reflections of fractals

Benchmarking - use website to drag/drop JSON file
    will be interesting to see what slows down when laptop is unplugged

Allow window scaling when the application is active
    should check online for reference material on how to change SDL2 window sizes (event)

Everything is squished when the aspect ratio is not a 480x270 ratio
    how do I fix this?  I want everything to look that same (eg same height/width ratio) regardless of window ratio
    Two things:
        1. Currently, the projection matrix in renderer is hard coded to 480x270 - need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        2. Currently, Squares.cpp uses 480x270 world space (related to projection) need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        3. Need to accomodate window scaling too

    Tests: (all squares should be squares, and rectangles should be 2:1)
        1. Check fullscreen
        2. Check windowed with 480x270 aspect ratio
        3. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 2:1
        4. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 1:2

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
