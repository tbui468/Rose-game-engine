REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)


start abstracting opengl out into renderer class (remove SDL renderer)

integrate glm for the mathy bits 
    test by making a simple matrix

loading sprites stb_image or SDL_image
    need to use opengl shaders to draw texture to test 

use opengl/glm and sprites and create some sample Fractals in Squares.cpp
    have them rotate, translate, and reflect
    once I know how to do it, start thinking about how to abstract into easy-to-use API

SDL tutorial on not putting everything in main (And logging)

Display FPS (on screen)
    look at Lazy Foo tutorial for basic and advanced timers


Look at LazyFoo website tutorial for setting up OpenGL with Glew (set up as SDL extension library??)
    abstract all opengl/SDL functionality to Renderer class

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)
