REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Input class
    Write Application::GetApplication() static function.  And declare and implement
    How about making Application a singleton???  There only ever should be one instance of it anyway
    then in main(), can call Application* app = Application::GetApp(); app->Run() etc
    in Layer Update(), can call Application* app = Application::GetApp();, app->Quit() when input == InputType::Close
        if I go this path will need to write some static functions/singleton stuff for Application class
        this seems like the best solution for the time being since it gives everyone access to the currently running application
            without having to pass a shared pointer to the application to everything

Move all server code to Rose.lib - pretty much everything else right now
    set up cmake to compile it to a static library

Move all client code to Squares.cpp - Squares, Button, and InputQueue

First create a mock-up of what I want the API from Squares.cpp to look like.  
    Then build the necessary structures to get there

    Should integrate Entities, Layer, and Application classes (current setup pretty much ignores Layers)
        Texture Map to access assets - maybe this should be global???  Or at least at the application level
        Client should specify Sprite name as a string, and when entity is created in application, load in appropriate sprite data/dimensions

        What should the API from Squares.cpp look like????


Get SDL to allow window resizing and toggle window/fullscreen
    how does this affect collision and so forth???
    maybe have a way to display coordinates on mouse position???


Have a way to set size of entity (eg, 64 x 32), so that sprite can vary in size
    bounding boxes are buggy (smaller than they should be)
    seems to be an issue with screen resolution and window size (related to below)
    Everything breaks when switching off fullscreen
        think about how I want to do this and togglefull screen often to check (maybe should make a key for this??? so I can change it during runtime)

Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
