REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Test animation of buttons (include Close button)
    Move AnimationTimer out of Rose and into Squares.cpp or integrate into Rose
    where do i put the OnANimationEnd()
    once it all works, remove all Entities (buttons) from Application.cpp (it should only exist in Squares)
    can delete Button.h class too since I want all client Entities declared/implement outside of Rose engine
    need to move a timer out of Application (since it's a client object now)
        timer is also needed to animate Buttons (onUpdate and OnAnimationEnd)

Add in BeginScene and EndScene to sandwich DrawScene is Renderer class 
    put all clear Quad code (this should be private) and any other housekeeping code in Begin and End
    DrawScene should only have the actual drawing stuff


Application
    add functions to load texture, and add sprite based on texture
    should be loading assets in main(), before app->Run() is called

Get SDL to allow window resizing and toggle window/fullscreen
    how does this affect collision and so forth???
    maybe have a way to display coordinates on mouse position???


Have a way to set size of entity (eg, 64 x 32), so that sprite can vary in size
    bounding boxes are buggy (smaller than they should be)
    seems to be an issue with screen resolution and window size (related to below)
    Everything breaks when switching off fullscreen
        think about how I want to do this and togglefull screen often to check (maybe should make a key for this??? so I can change it during runtime)

Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
