REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Create Puzzleset entities and have them animate in when player clicks on start button

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
