REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Squares.cpp is getting big
    create Squares directory
    dump all classes into separate files there
    update Cmake file

PuzzleSelectors
    Drawing them on screen
    Animating them on screen
    Clickable
    Clicking them moves puzzles left/right

Move App->Draw(entity) to Entity->Draw()
    reason: I want to be able to overload entity draw calls
        so I can have the puzzleiconselector draw the puzzleicons it has,
        I may do the same thing for PuzzleSets (having puzzlesets perform the draw call for all of its puzzles)

Allow window scaling when the application is active
    should check online for reference material on how to change SDL2 window sizes (event)

Everything is squished when the aspect ratio is not a 480x270 ratio
    how do I fix this?  I want everything to look that same (eg same height/width ratio) regardless of window ratio
    Two things:
        1. Currently, the projection matrix in renderer is hard coded to 480x270 - need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        2. Currently, Squares.cpp uses 480x270 world space (related to projection) need to change this to accomodate aspect ratio of window
        3. Need to accomodate window scaling too

    Tests: (all squares should be squares, and rectangles should be 2:1)
        1. Check fullscreen
        2. Check windowed with 480x270 aspect ratio
        3. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 2:1
        4. Check windowed with aspect ratio of 1:2

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
