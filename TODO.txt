REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

Have everything scaled at 4x

Bounding boxes
    when creating an object, the sprite is also the bounding box
    default size is 32x32 for all entities

Get SDL to allow window resizing and toggle window/fullscreen
    GetWindowSize()???? <- what does this currently give us??
    how does this affect collision and so forth???
    maybe have a way to display coordinates on mouse position???
    current hard coded coordinates don't work for full screen - need to grab current window size - not the saved ones

    related: need to scale bounding boxes too to window sizes

    related: Cameras and view matrix/projection matrix

Create puzzleset sprites and add them to sprite sheet

Create Puzzleset entities and have them animate in when player clicks on start button

Have a way to set size of entity (eg, 64 x 32), so that sprite can vary in size
    bounding boxes are buggy (smaller than they should be)
    seems to be an issue with screen resolution and window size (related to below)
    Everything breaks when switching off fullscreen
        think about how I want to do this and togglefull screen often to check (maybe should make a key for this??? so I can change it during runtime)

Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
