REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

currently system is set up fine! :)  Now, pull all common elements out to make a simple API for client to use
    first step could be to pull OpenGL stuff to Renderer class (all of it: don't really need to split it into vertex/index buffers etc)
    


Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)
