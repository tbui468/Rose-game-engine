REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

It was a problem with textures and sprite name not being valid
    add in Debug mode with macros
    add in ASSERTs with macros when debug mode is enabled
    do a check on sprite names to make sure this same bug doesn't show up

Application
    add functions to load texture, and add sprite based on texture
    should be loading assets in main(), before app->Run() is called

Get SDL to allow window resizing and toggle window/fullscreen
    how does this affect collision and so forth???
    maybe have a way to display coordinates on mouse position???


Have a way to set size of entity (eg, 64 x 32), so that sprite can vary in size
    bounding boxes are buggy (smaller than they should be)
    seems to be an issue with screen resolution and window size (related to below)
    Everything breaks when switching off fullscreen
        think about how I want to do this and togglefull screen often to check (maybe should make a key for this??? so I can change it during runtime)

Abstract things away as needed based on how the last step went to prepare for the next step

Make puzzlesets, puzzles and fractals (the most complex class) - abstract or refactor as needed

Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC)
