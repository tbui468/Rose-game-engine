REMEMBER: GET IT UP AND RUNNING ASAP (details and optimizations can come later)

    PITCH: An application teaching goemetric transformations using puzzles, but the app itself is a puzzle the user must explore to unravel

            design issues: how do I want puzzles to connect to puzzlesets?  And how will puzzlesets connect to the application in general?
                a good sentence in a novel needs to provide information about character, plot, or setting (or all three)
                a good interactive application needs to provide information about 
                    1. ruleset of the world (transformations, essentially) and how making squares of same color clear that puzzle
                    2. how the ruleset integrates the world ....
                        each set is composed of 4(?) puzzles
                        the world is composed of clusters of 4 sets???
                    3. ...

                look at notebook for design notes
                    the puzzle interaction needs to be clarified and fleshed out ( main problem is I don't like solving puzzles in 3 dimensions)
                        solving in 3 dimensions requires too much input to see all possibilities, whereas for 2-d puzzles all the information
                        can be present on screen at one time.  In real life this is less of a problem since rotating a rubrik's cube with 
                        your hands is significantly easier than doing the same on a digital screen (due to the simple fact that we use our hands
                        on a daily basis and only use my application / mouse and keyboard for limited time a day)

                        The third dimension is more useful for exploration / building atmosphere than to solve complex puzzles (at least with the current 
                            limitations in user input - touchscreen, mouse, keyboard)  That will change once VR tech becomes more commonplace and advanced

                        -solving fractal puzzles is mostly clear (connecting colored line segments across surface of a square)
                        -solving cube faces puzzle is fuzzy (connecting colored line segments wrapped around 6 surfaces of a cube, but requires 3-d motion????)
                        -solving 8 cubes puzzles for tesseract if very fuzzy (I don't know how I want to do this)


    THE BIG THREE:
        3. Core Puzzle Features - transformations/splitting/forming and puzzle clear/puzzleset clear (do this in the morning)

            look at Fractal::FindOverlapType(...) and Puzzle::SplitOverlappingWith(...) 

            test on 4x4 fractals with undo using bare minimum resizing - not working correctly (where is it failing?)
                not splitting up 4x4 (or it's splitting but not animating)
                trace what is happening using std::cout 


            saving Undo data

            puzzle clear and puzzleset clear

        1. Save/load system - SDL_GetPrefPath

            save and load undo stacks


        2. Audio - FMOD
            Sound is playing on translate up 
            Get music looping

        Learn.
            Watch Javidx9 videos or look through the code of his game engine
                get a working program compiled with his engine, and
                step through the code to see how he structured everything (especially the renderer and entity relationship for Draw())

            OLCGameEngine
                application->Draw(....) is how the application draws stuff
                I could just do Draw(entity.x, entity.y, entity.Sprite, etc) to draw
                    but i need to be able to draw objects and entity contains too


Set build (x86 or x64) (or should this be a build option???)

Open and build in visual studio using solutions generated by cmake to test if it works

Build on linux virtual machine to test different compiler (GCC) and the LLVM one (Clang)

Need to make sure MAX_VERTEX size in shaders are below hardware max 

Make sure I'm compile to release mode (and not debug) with optimizations turned to max
